# Production Deployment Steps - Quick Start Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status: Release Build Working!

Your app successfully builds for release. Here are the immediate steps to launch.

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Configure App Signing (30 minutes)

### Generate Release Keystore:

```bash
cd /Users/joan.heredia/AndroidStudioProjects/FontsReviewer

# Generate keystore (one-time)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore fontsreviewer-release.keystore \
  -alias fontsreviewer \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Keystore password (save in password manager!)
# - Your name
# - Organization
# - City, State, Country
```

### Create `keystore.properties`:

```bash
# Create file (never commit to git!)
cat > keystore.properties << EOF
storeFile=fontsreviewer-release.keystore
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyAlias=fontsreviewer
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
EOF
```

### Update `.gitignore`:

```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "*.keystore" >> .gitignore
echo "keystore.properties" >> .gitignore
```

### Update `app/build.gradle.kts`:

Add signing configuration:

```kotlin
android {
    // ... existing config ...
    
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
            if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
                val keystoreProperties = java.util.Properties()
                keystoreProperties.load(java.io.FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
                
                storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
                storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
                keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
                keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
            }
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
            isMinifyEnabled = true
            isShrinkResources = true
            proguardFiles(
                getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"),
                "proguard-rules.pro"
            )
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üéØ Step 2: Build Signed Release (10 minutes)

### Option A: APK (for direct distribution)
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Output: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
# Size: ~20-30 MB
```

### Option B: AAB (for Play Store - Recommended)
```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Output: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
# Size: ~15-20 MB (smaller than APK)
```

### Test the Signed APK:
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Test thoroughly:
# - Signup/Login
# - View map
# - Submit reviews
# - Check leaderboard
# - Test as operator and admin
```
