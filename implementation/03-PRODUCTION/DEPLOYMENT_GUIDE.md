## üîê Step 1: Generate Release Keystore (30 minutes)

### Why This is Critical
Your keystore is your app's identity on the Play Store. **If you lose it, you can NEVER update your app again.** You'll have to publish as a completely new app.

### Generate the Keystore

```bash
cd /Users/joan.heredia/AndroidStudioProjects/FontsReviewer

# Generate keystore (one-time only!)
keytool -genkey -v \
  -keystore fontsreviewer-release.keystore \
  -alias fontsreviewer \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Keystore password (choose strong password!)
# - Your name
# - Organization unit (can be "Personal" or your company)
# - Organization (your name or company)
# - City
# - State/Province
# - Country code (ES for Spain)
```

**Example Session:**
```
Enter keystore password: [your secure password]
Re-enter new password: [confirm password]
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  Joan Heredia
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Personal
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  watxaut
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Barcelona
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  Catalonia
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  ES
Is CN=Joan Heredia, OU=Personal, O=watxaut, L=Barcelona, ST=Catalonia, C=ES correct?
  [no]:  yes

Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate (SHA256withRSA)
  with a validity of 10,000 days...
```

### Create keystore.properties

```bash
# Create properties file
cat > keystore.properties << 'EOF'
storeFile=fontsreviewer-release.keystore
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyAlias=fontsreviewer
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
EOF
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` with the password you just created
- `YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD` with the same password (or different if you chose different)

### Secure Your Keystore

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NEVER COMMIT THESE TO GIT**

```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "*.keystore" >> .gitignore
echo "keystore.properties" >> .gitignore

# Verify gitignore worked
git status
# Should NOT show keystore or properties files
```

**Backup Strategy:**
1. **Immediate:** Copy keystore + properties to USB drive
2. **Cloud:** Upload to password-protected cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
3. **Password Manager:** Store keystore password in password manager (1Password, LastPass)
4. **Physical:** Print keystore password and store in safe

**You MUST have at least 2 backups in different locations.**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure App Signing (15 minutes)

### Update app/build.gradle.kts

Open `app/build.gradle.kts` and add signing configuration:

```kotlin
// At the top of the file, before android block
import java.util.Properties
import java.io.FileInputStream

// Load keystore properties
val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
val keystoreProperties = Properties()
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    namespace = "com.watxaut.fontsreviewer"
    compileSdk = 36

    // ... existing config ...

    // ADD THIS: Signing configs
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
                storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
                storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
                keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
                keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
            }
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            // ADD THIS LINE:
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
            
            // Existing config (keep these):
            isMinifyEnabled = true
            isShrinkResources = true
            proguardFiles(
                getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"),
                "proguard-rules.pro"
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### Verify Configuration

```bash
# Sync Gradle files
./gradlew --stop
./gradlew tasks

# Should complete without errors
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 3: Build Signed Release (10 minutes)

### Option A: Build AAB for Play Store (Recommended)

```bash
# Clean first
./gradlew clean

# Build release bundle
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Output will be at:
# app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

**AAB Benefits:**
- Smaller download size for users (~15-20 MB)
- Required by Play Store
- Google generates optimized APKs per device

### Option B: Build APK for Direct Distribution

```bash
# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Output will be at:
# app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**APK Use Cases:**
- Direct distribution (beta testing before Play Store)
- Backup copy
- Side-loading

### Verify Signing

```bash
# Check if APK is signed
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs \
  app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Should see: "jar verified"
```

---

## üß™ Step 4: Test Release Build (2 hours)

**Critical:** Release builds behave differently than debug builds!

### Install Release APK

```bash
# Install on connected device/emulator
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# If already installed:
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with Signing Error

**Error:** `Could not find keystore file`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check keystore exists
ls -la fontsreviewer-release.keystore

# Check keystore.properties path
cat keystore.properties

# Keystore path should be relative: fontsreviewer-release.keystore
# Not absolute: /Users/joan/...
```

### APK Installs But Crashes Immediately

**Cause:** ProGuard removed necessary code

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check ProGuard rules in proguard-rules.pro
# Add keep rules for Supabase, Mapbox, Hilt

# See full rules in project
```

### Google Rejects: "Privacy Policy Not Accessible"

**Solution:**
1. Test URL in incognito browser
2. Make sure it's `https://` not `http://`
3. Verify no login required
4. Check it loads on mobile

### Google Rejects: "App Crashes"

**Solution:**
1. They tested on a device you didn't test on
2. Check crash reports in Play Console
3. Fix the crash
4. Upload new AAB
5. Resubmit
