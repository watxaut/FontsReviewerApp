# Production Readiness Checklist - FontsReviewer Barcelona

## 📋 Pre-Launch Checklist

### ✅ Critical (Must Complete Before Launch)

  - [ ] `USER_ROLES_MIGRATION.sql` - User roles (admin/operator)
- [ ] **Import fountain data:** All 1745 Barcelona fountains in Supabase
- [ ] **Verify data:**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fountains; -- Should be 1745
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
  SELECT * FROM fountain_stats_detailed LIMIT 5;
  ```

  UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE nickname = 'your_nickname';
  ```

  ```
- [ ] **Never commit `local.properties`** to git (already in `.gitignore`)

## 🔑 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### **Step 1: Fix Release Build**
```bash
# Clean everything
./gradlew clean
rm -rf app/build

# Build release
./gradlew assembleRelease

# If successful, test the APK
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk
```

### **Step 2: Generate Signing Key**
```bash
# Create release keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore fontsreviewer-release.keystore \
  -alias fontsreviewer -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Store securely - NEVER commit to git!
# Add to .gitignore
echo "*.keystore" >> .gitignore
echo "keystore.properties" >> .gitignore
```

### **Step 3: Configure Signing in build.gradle.kts**
```kotlin
android {
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            // Read from keystore.properties
            val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
            if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
                val keystoreProperties = Properties()
                keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
                
                storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
                storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
                keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
                keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
            }
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
            // ... rest of config
        }
    }
}
```

### **Step 4: Test Everything**
- [ ] Create test account
- [ ] Submit review for 3+ fountains
- [ ] Check leaderboard
- [ ] Test as operator (location restrictions)
- [ ] Test as admin (no restrictions)
- [ ] Test offline mode
- [ ] Test different Android versions

## 📱 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### **To Fix Before Launch:**

1. **Review Schema - Missing Fields:**
   - Current: 4 categories (taste, freshness, location, aesthetics)
   - CSV shows: 6 categories (+ splash, jet)
   - **Action:** Verify database schema matches app code
   - **Status:** ✅ Already aligned (6 categories in DB)

2. **Comment Field:**
   - **Status:** ✅ Removed from UI (as requested)
   - **Database:** Still has `comment` field (nullable)
   - **Action:** Keep in DB for future use

3. **Pagination Performance:**
   - Fetches 1745 fountains in 2 batches (~500ms)
   - **Optimization:** Add local caching for offline support
   - **Priority:** 🟢 Low (current performance acceptable)

---

## 🔒 Security Checklist

### **✅ Implemented:**
