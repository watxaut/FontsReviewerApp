### 🏗️ Architecture (95%)

**Pattern:** Clean Architecture + MVVM

#### Domain Layer (100%) ✅
- **Models:** Fountain, Review, User, FountainWithStats
- **Repository Interfaces:** FountainRepository, ReviewRepository, AuthRepository
- **Use Cases:**
  - ✅ GetFountainsUseCase
  - ✅ LoginUseCase
  - ✅ RegisterUseCase
  - ✅ SubmitReviewUseCase
  - ✅ GetUserStatsUseCase
  - ✅ GetLeaderboardUseCase
  - ✅ GetReviewsForFountainUseCase
  - ✅ CreateFountainUseCase (admin)
  - ✅ SoftDeleteFountainUseCase (admin)

#### Data Layer (95%) ✅
- **Remote:**
  - ✅ SupabaseService (all API calls)
  - ✅ DTOs (FountainDto, ReviewDto, ProfileDto, etc.)
  - ✅ Mappers (DTO ↔ Domain models)
- **Repositories:**
  - ✅ FountainRepositoryImpl (Supabase-backed)
  - ✅ ReviewRepositoryImpl (Supabase-backed)
  - ✅ AuthRepositoryImpl (Supabase Auth)
- **⚠️ Known Issue:** MapViewModel directly injects SupabaseService (architecture violation)
  - See: `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` #2
  - Fix: Create GetUserReviewedFountainsUseCase

#### Presentation Layer (95%) ✅
- ✅ All ViewModels use StateFlow
- ✅ Proper state management
- ✅ Error handling with Result<T>

- ⚠️ One architecture violation (MapViewModel)

**Dependency Injection:** Hilt fully configured and working.

---

### 🗄️ Backend (100%)

**Platform:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)

#### Database Schema ✅
- **Tables:**
  - `profiles` - User accounts (id, nickname, total_ratings, average_score, best_fountain_id, role)
  - `reviews` - Fountain reviews (6 rating categories + overall calculated)
  - `fountains` - 1,745 Barcelona fountains (with is_deleted for soft delete)

- **Views:**
  - `leaderboard` - User rankings (auto-updates via triggers)
  - `fountain_stats_detailed` - Fountains with aggregated review stats
  - `fountain_stats` - Backward compatibility view

- **Functions:**
  - `is_admin(user_uuid)` - Check if user is admin
  - `soft_delete_fountain(codi)` - Admin soft delete
  - `restore_fountain(codi)` - Admin restore

- **Triggers:**
  - `handle_new_user()` - Auto-create profile on signup
  - `update_user_stats()` - Update user stats after review

#### Security ✅
- **RLS (Row Level Security):** Enabled on all tables
- **Policies:**
  - Profiles: Public read, users can update own
  - Reviews: Public read, users can CRUD own
  - Fountains: Public read non-deleted, admins can manage all
- **Cascading Deletes:** Profile deletion → Reviews auto-deleted

#### Migrations ✅
All 4 migrations applied (see `01-MIGRATIONS/MIGRATION_HISTORY.md`):
1. ✅ Fountains table + views
2. ✅ User roles (admin/operator)
3. ✅ Admin fountain management (soft delete)
4. ✅ Account deletion (CASCADE)

---

### 👥 User Roles (100%)

**Two user types implemented:**

#### Operator (Default)
- Can view all fountains
- Can view all reviews anonymously
- Can submit reviews **only within 300m** of fountain
- Location check enforced in app (GPS-based)
- Can view own stats
- Can delete own account

#### Admin
- All operator permissions +
- Can review fountains from **anywhere** (no 300m limit)
- Can create new fountains (future feature)
- Can soft-delete fountains
- Can restore deleted fountains

**Set Admin:**
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE nickname = 'watxaut';
```

---

### 🔒 Security (90%)

**Implemented:**
- ✅ HTTPS-only traffic (network security config)
- ✅ Row Level Security on all tables
- ✅ Credentials in BuildConfig (not committed to git)
- ✅ ProGuard/R8 enabled for release builds
- ✅ Code obfuscation
- ✅ Auth tokens in secure storage
- ✅ Input validation (email, nickname, password)
- ✅ No cleartext traffic allowed
- ✅ Backup exclusion rules (auth tokens not backed up)

**Needs Attention:**
- ⚠️ Debug logs still present in some files (see `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`)
- ⚠️ Could add SSL certificate pinning (optional)
- ⚠️ Could add root detection (optional)

**Security Grade:** 85/100 (Good for production, can be hardened further)

## ⚠️ What Needs Attention (5%)

### 🔴 Critical (Must Fix Before Launch)

#### 1. App Signing Configuration
**Status:** ❌ Not configured  
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Blocker:** YES - Required to upload to Play Store

**Action:**
```bash
# Generate keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore fontsreviewer-release.keystore \
  -alias fontsreviewer -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Configure in build.gradle.kts
# See: 03-PRODUCTION/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
```

#### 2. Privacy Policy
**Status:** ❌ Not written  
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Blocker:** YES - Required by Play Store

**Action:**
- Write privacy policy (template in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- Host online (GitHub Pages or your domain)
- Add URL to Play Store listing

#### 3. Play Store Listing
**Status:** ❌ Not created  
**Time:** 3 hours  
**Blocker:** YES - Required to publish

**Action:**
- Take 4-8 screenshots
- Write descriptions (EN/ES/CA)
- Create app icon (512x512)
- Create feature graphic (1024x500)

---

### 🟡 Important (Should Fix)

#### 4. MapViewModel Architecture Violation
**Status:** ⚠️ Known issue  
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Priority:** High (code quality)

**Issue:** MapViewModel directly injects SupabaseService instead of using a use case.

**Fix:** Create `GetUserReviewedFountainsUseCase` - see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` #2

#### 5. Room Database Dead Code
**Status:** ⚠️ Unused code  
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Priority:** Medium (reduces APK size)

**Issue:** Entire `data/local/` directory exists but is never used. All data comes from Supabase.

**Fix:** Delete Room-related files (~7 files) - see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` #1

#### 6. Email Verification
**Status:** ❌ Not enabled  
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Priority:** High (prevents spam accounts)

**Action:**
- Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
- Enable "Confirm email" option

#### 7. Crash Reporting
**Status:** ❌ Not configured  
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Priority:** High (essential for production monitoring)

**Action:**
- Add Firebase Crashlytics
- See: `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for setup

---

### 🟢 Optional Enhancements

#### 8. Account Deletion Edge Function
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial implementation  
**Priority:** Low (manual deletion works for MVP)

**Current:** Profile deletion works (cascade deletes reviews). Auth user remains in database.

**Future:** Deploy Supabase Edge Function for full auth.users deletion.

See: `04-SETUP_GUIDES/EDGE_FUNCTION_SETUP.md`

#### 9. Unit Tests
**Status:** ❌ Not implemented  
**Priority:** Low (can add post-launch)

#### 10. UI Tests
**Status:** ❌ Not implemented  
**Priority:** Low (can add post-launch)
